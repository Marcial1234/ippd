### Instalation
+ Install *Hugin* by either installing [Hugin-win64.msi](real-mean/Hugin-win64.msi) on windows, or [download it](http://hugin.sourceforge.net/download/) if you're not on Window x64
+ Add the files inside `real-mean\stiching` to your path

### Use
- Once the above it's done, run `gear360pano [either a wildcard or path to unstriched files]`
    - Works on windows x64
    - If not, manually run `gear360pano.cmd [path to unstiched files]` on the bash script's directory.

'Stitched' panoramic files will be dumped as `[original file name]-pano.[original extension]`
