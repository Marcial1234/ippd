Idea for Map View => done
  last resort ~ send picture to frontend?
  just have 'boxes' with number input fields/dropdowns
  Have a defined start point and end point (cotiguous space)
  === end of frontend ~
  n^2 lazy parsing, find out how many used, push as you see ~
  auto assign rotations based relative coors ~
  record index of start ~
    [step].join(""):
      "01" => right 90
      "10" => left -90
      "-10" => forward 0
      "0-1" => backward -178?
      
  TODO Later:
  delete pics not used
  * view from button-to-top as front/back *
    - need a huge ass visual indicator
        - ARROWS!

Idea for image uploading:
  Move to server on bldg => floor hash based folder structure
  Stitch
  get index: url mapping, with some time of DB/endpoint parsing? via a DB boolean
  create room objects from that
  add them to floor.photos

  return promise to frontend once done ~
  or one by one??

Go to stuart ~

Other TODOs:
  Move to remote image sources/uris => kevin

  Picture uploading and mapping !!

  ===

  Bldg and note search view

  "/preview" endpoint to server ~ _tab pano
    refactor current app to now show menu overlay ~
    just need a barebone view

  no name/text navs? 
    null => "go" tooltip
    default to "next"? or hide it altogether?

  Create a '404' eq for react vr if nothing is passed ~ 
    Basic/Template view, with either our/verizon's logo and some 'not supposed to be here'/'wrong page' message
